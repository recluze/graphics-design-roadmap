# Graphics Design Roadmap 

I'm setting up a roadmap for graphics designing (as part of our efforts at COLAB - NUCES Peshawar Campus). 

Since this is a sensitive area in some senses, I'm going to outline some personal rules. I'm going to 
enforce these rules on a personal level. So, you will not get any feedback from me on any work that violates 
these rules. If you have any confusions about these rules, please feel free to ask me for clarification. 

While these rules might seem too stringent at first glance, I can assure you that a wide range of artistic 
freedom can be exercised while staying within these boudnaries. 

## Rules 

* In **print**, all photos, sketches, doodles or any other depictions of animate objects are impermissible.   
* In their **digital form**, photos of animate objects are allowed so long as the subject matter isn't 
  something impermissible (more on this in the endnote). 
* Sketches or paintings (i.e. any art form other than photos) of animate objects is impermisslbe *even in 
  digital form*. 
* If you move towards the area of animations and video, music is impermissible. 
* Design promoting any impermissible event/idea is also impermissible. 

## Opting Out 

This course is completely optional. So, if you ever feel that you don't want to (or cannot) continue with 
the course, simply drop me a line saying that you have to work on your formal courses. There will be no hard 
feelings because I understand that this might not be something everyone would want to spend their time on. 

## Joining the Course 

If you agree, please respond to the person who sent you the invite with the following message: `Please add [your-email-address]` where `your-email-address` should be the address that should be added to the teachable course. 

## Endnote 

Perimssibility of digital photos is a disputed ruling among contemporary scholars. One rather large group 
of authentic scholars advocates the permissibility of digital photos (so long as they remain in their 
digital form and are not printed). This is the school of thought being followed here.
